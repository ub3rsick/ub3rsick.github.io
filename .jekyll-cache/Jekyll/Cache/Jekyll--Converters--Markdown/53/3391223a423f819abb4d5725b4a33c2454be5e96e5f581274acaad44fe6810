I"n<p>The fourth assignment is to create a custom shellcode encoder and decoder. The whole point of encoding shellcode is change its signature so that the shellcode is not detected by Antivirus softwares and Intrution Detection Systems. This is critical in most of real world exploitation scenarios where AV and IDS are present. The encoder will change the original shellcode into some other shellcode which in assembly might seem like meaningless instructions. Upon execution, the decoder stub present before the encoded shellcode will decode the encoded shellcode and once completed will jump to the decoded shellcode.</p>
